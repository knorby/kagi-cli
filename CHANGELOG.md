# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to this project should be documented in this file.

This project follows Keep a Changelog style and uses semantic versioning after `1.0.0`.
Before `1.0.0`, breaking changes may still ship in minor releases.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1]

### Added

- Interactive `kagi auth` wizard for TTY setup with guided Session Link and API Token flows
- Recorded auth demo assets and auth-wizard onboarding coverage across the docs

### Changed

- Made `kagi auth` the primary local setup path while keeping `auth status`, `auth check`, and `auth set` for explicit non-interactive use
- Tightened auth copy, terminal presentation, and config-save flow with overwrite prompts, preferred-auth prompts, and environment override notices

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- `kagi quick` with JSON, compact, pretty, and markdown output plus structured references and follow-up questions
- `kagi translate` text-mode support with detection, alternatives, alignments, suggestions, and word insights

### Changed

- Expanded docs, demos, and output contracts to cover Quick Answer and Translate alongside the existing search and Assistant flows
- Optimized bundled demo and tutorial image assets across the repo

### Fixed

- Made translate bootstrap retry the flaky missing-cookie path instead of failing on the first transient response
- Fixed the release workflow package-index sync step to export the GitHub token for the Homebrew tap and Scoop bucket push path

### Added

- Search V2 session-backed filters for runtime search refinement and batch parity
- Assistant thread management with list, get, export, and delete flows
- `ask-page` for page-focused Assistant questions with structured JSON output

### Changed

## [0.1.5]

- Made unsupported Windows ARM64 installs fail fast with a clear error instead of a 404
- Switched npm publishing automation to run after the `Release` workflow completes

## [0.1.4]

### Fixed

- Tagged the release from the corrected commit so GitHub Releases and npm publication use the synchronized package metadata

## [0.1.3]

### Fixed

- Synchronized the Rust package version in `Cargo.lock` with `Cargo.toml` so locked release builds succeed

### Fixed

- Aligned the npm wrapper version with the release tag used for native binary downloads

## [0.1.1]
