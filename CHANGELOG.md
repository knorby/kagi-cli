# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to this project should be documented in this file.

Before `1.0.0`, breaking changes may still ship in minor releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ongoing documentation and release process improvements

## [0.1.5]

### Fixed

- Added ARM64 Linux release artifacts so install flows work on `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- Made unsupported Windows ARM64 installs fail fast with a clear error instead of a 404
- Switched npm publishing automation to run after the `Release` workflow completes

## [0.1.4]

### Fixed

- Tagged the release from the corrected commit so GitHub Releases and npm publication use the synchronized package metadata

## [0.1.3]

### Fixed

- Synchronized the Rust package version in `Cargo.lock` with `Cargo.toml` so locked release builds succeed

### Fixed

- Aligned the npm wrapper version with the release tag used for native binary downloads

## [0.1.1]
